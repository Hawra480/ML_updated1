# ML_updated1
This is an updated code for ML using sklearn module
This is an updated code for ML using sklearn module: this module has most of the functions already defined so I stopped the work on my previous code(As I was defining functions one by one ). 
It took me several trials to get it right. The accuracy of ML prediction based on the training is appro 80%.
All included studies by ML, or based on human decision will be subjected to title and abstract review and if still eligible for inclusion will be subjected to full text review.

To access codes and inputfiles please go to ML training, which has the following: 
1- model selection code: this is the code where I tested several algorthem to see which one can be trained best to give high accurcy. 
based on model selection_test I used one module
2- Algorthim comparision graph
3-input file named ML_screening1.csv
4-Training and prediction code
